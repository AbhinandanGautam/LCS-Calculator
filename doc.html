              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is a classical problem in computer science, and forms the basis of the current best-performing reference-based compression schemes for genome resequencing data.</p>
              <p>Given two strings: string X of length m [X(1..m)], and string Y of length n [Y(1..n)], find the longest common subsequence: the longest sequence of characters that appear left-to-right (but not necessarily in a contiguous block) in both strings. For example, if X = “ABCBDAB” and Y = “BDCABA”, the LCS(X, Y) = {“BCBA”, “BDAB”, “BCAB”}. We can see there are several optimal solutions.</p>

              <h4>Methods To Solve LCS Problem</h4>
              <div class="container my-2">
                <h5>1. Brute Force Approach</h5>
                <p>One simple idea is to check every subsequence of X[1.. m] (m is the length of sequence X) to see if it is also a subsequence of Y[1..n] (n is the length of sequence Y). Checking takes O(n) time, and there are 2<sup>m</sup> subsequences of X. The running time thus is exponential O(n. 2<sup>m</sup>) and is not good for large sequences.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="container my-2">
                <h5>2. Recursive Approach</h5>
                <p>Before going to DP solution, let us form the recursive solution for this and later we can add memoization to reduce the complexity. Let’s start with some simple observations about the LCS problem. If we have two strings, say “ABCBDAB” and “BDCABA”, and if we draw lines from the letters in the first string to the corresponding letters in the second, no two lines cross.</p>
                <p>Thus, we can see that the current characters of X and Y may or may not match. That means, suppose that the two first characters differ. Then it is not possible for both of them to be part of a common subsequence - one or the other (or maybe both) will have to be removed. Finally, observe that once we have decided what to do with the first characters of the strings, the remaining sub problem is again a LCS problem, on two shorter strings. Therefore we can solve it recursively.</p>
                <p>The solution to LCS should find two sequences in X and Y and let us say the starting index of sequence in X is i and the starting index of sequence in Y is j. Also, assume that X[i ...m] is a substring of X starting at character i and going until the end of X, and that Y[j ...n] is a substring of Y starting at character j and going until the end of Y.</p>
                <p>Based on the above discussion, here we get the possibilities as described below: <ol><li>If X[i] == Y[j] : 1 + LCS(i + 1,j + 1)</li><li>If X[i] ≠ Y[j]. LCS(i,j + 1) // skipping j<sup>th</sup> character of Y</li><li>If X[i] ≠ Y[j]. LCS(i + 1,j) // skipping i<sup>th</sup> character of X</li></ol></p>
                <p>In the first case, if X[i] is equal to Y[j], we get a matching pair and can count it towards the total length of the LCS. Otherwise, we need to skip either i<sup>th</sup> character of X or j<sup>th</sup> character of Y and find the longest common subsequence.</p>
                <p>This is a correct solution but it is very time consuming. For example, if the two strings have no matching characters, the last line always gets executed which gives (if m == n) close to O(2<sup>n</sup>).</p>

                <h5>3. Dynamic Programming Approach</h5>
                <p>Let us take two sequences:</p>

                <ol><li>Create a table of dimension <code>n+1*m+1</code> where n and m are the lengths of <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> respectively. The first row and the first column are filled with zeros.

                    <figure><img alt="Longest Common Subsequence initialise table" height="255" src="//cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/lcs-Table-1.png" title="initialise a table" width="278"><figcaption>Initialise a table</figcaption></figure></li>
                <li>Fill each cell of the table using the following logic.</li>
                <li>If the character correspoding to the current row and current column are matching, then fill the current cell by adding one to the diagonal element. Point an arrow to the diagonal cell.</li>
                <li>Else take the maximum value from the previous column and previous row element for filling the current cell. Point an arrow to the cell with maximum value. If they are equal, point to any of them.
                    <figure><img alt="Longest Common Subsequence fill the values" height="255" src="//cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/lcs-Table-2.png" title="fill the values" width="278"><figcaption>Fill the values</figcaption></figure></li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong> is repeated until the table is filled.
                    <figure><img alt="Longest Common Subsequence fill all the values" height="255" src="//cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/lcs-Table-3.png" title="fill all the values" width="278"><figcaption>Fill all the values</figcaption></figure></li>
                <li>The value in the last row and the last column is the length of the longest common subsequence.

                <li>In order to find the longest common subsequence, start from the last element and follow the direction of the arrow. The elements corresponding to () symbol form the longest common subsequence.
